        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>
            Sate ayam, or chicken satay, is a popular Indonesian dish known for its delightful skewered and grilled chicken. The chicken pieces are marinated in a flavorful mixture of soy sauce, 
            garlic, ginger, and various spices, imparting a savory and aromatic taste. Skewered onto sticks, the marinated chicken is then grilled or charbroiled to perfection. Sate ayam is often 
            served with a side of peanut sauce, adding a rich and nutty complement to the tender and succulent chicken. This dish is a beloved street food and a favorite at social gatherings, 
            showcasing the vibrant flavors of Indonesian cuisine.
